# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Checkpointable training hooks. Hooks such as EMA can now save restart
  state with strategy checkpoints, so resumed training keeps averaged
  weights instead of starting them over.
- Training strategy checkpoint restart support, including a periodic
  checkpoint hook for step- or epoch-based saves and restart loading with
  models, optimizers, schedulers, runtime counters, and restart-safe device
  placement.
- First-class validation on `TrainingStrategy`. Set a `ValidationConfig`
  on `strategy.validation_config` and validation runs automatically at the
  configured step or epoch cadence, plus one final pass at end-of-training;
  the latest summary is stored on `strategy.last_validation`. Mechanics live
  in a public, context-managed `ValidationLoop` that can also be run
  standalone outside training. An `inference_model` slot lets EMA (or SWA /
  a distillation teacher) publish averaged weights for validation to read.
  A new `AFTER_VALIDATION` hook stage fires immediately after each pass so
   loggers can read the live summary. For per-batch logging, pass a
   `batch_callback` (any object matching the `BatchValidationCallback`
   protocol) on the config; it is invoked once per validation batch with the
   batch, predictions, and per-batch loss.
- Metric-driven learning-rate schedulers. `ReduceLROnPlateau` is now
  supported via `OptimizerConfig.scheduler_metric_adapter` (a summary-dict
  key string or a callable). Time-based schedulers step every optimizer
  step as before; metric-driven schedulers step only at validation
  checkpoints, where the validation summary supplies the metric.

### Core Data Layer

- **User-specified transforms** - `Dataset` accepts a `transforms=` kwarg
  (per-sample `(AtomicData, metadata) -> (AtomicData, metadata)`) and
  `DataLoader` accepts a `batch_transforms=` kwarg (per-batch `Batch -> Batch`).
  Both default to `None` (backward compatible). New `nvalchemi.data.transforms`
  subpackage exposes a polymorphic `Compose` utility plus `SampleTransform`
  and `BatchTransform` type aliases, re-exported from `nvalchemi.data`.
  Per-sample transforms run after device transfer on both sync and prefetch
  paths; per-batch transforms run on the consumer thread after `Batch.from_data_list`.
  Transform failures are wrapped in `RuntimeError` with `transform[<i>]`
  breadcrumb and `__cause__` preserved.

### Fixed

- **Zarr dataloader custom fields** — validated `Dataset` batch paths now
  preserve reader field-level metadata so custom atom-, edge-, and
  system-level tensors survive batching like the `skip_validation` path.
- **MTK NPT barostat runaway** (#89, #90) — four bugs in
  `nvalchemi/dynamics/integrators/npt.py` (with matching fixes in
  `nph.py`) that combined to drive unbounded cell-volume drift in long
  NPT runs. Cross-validated against ASE `MTKNPT`/`IsotropicMTKNPT` and
  TorchSim `npt_nose_hoover_isotropic`. Isotropic users will see their
  barostat mass `W` shrink by 3× (now matches canonical MTK).
- **Ewald / PME energies buffer leak** (#82) — in-place `scatter_add_`
  of gradient-carrying `per_atom_energies` chained each forward's Warp
  backward tape onto `_energies_buf`, causing linear per-step slowdown
  and unbounded GPU memory growth. `detach_()` the buffer after each
  forward.

### Deprecated

- `cells_inv` argument on `_cell_kinetic_energy`. Cell kinetic energy
  is computed directly from the strain rate `ε̇` and no longer needs
  the cell inverse. The argument is retained for backwards
  compatibility (a `DeprecationWarning` is emitted when passed) and
  will be removed in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

- Split hook context state into `HookContext`, `DynamicsContext`, and
  `TrainContext` so each workflow exposes only the fields it owns.
  Dynamics-specific state such as `step_count`, `converged_mask`, and
  `global_rank` now lives on `DynamicsContext`, while training state lives on
  `TrainContext`. Existing hooks that used `HookContext` for dynamics-only
  fields should update their annotations to `DynamicsContext`.
- Standardized public `stress` outputs on tensile-positive Cauchy stress
  (`sigma = -W / V`) while keeping low-level virials defined as negative
  strain derivatives.
- Removed `EvaluateHook` in favor of first-class validation on
  `TrainingStrategy`. Validation is no longer a registered hook. Migrate by
  moving the hook's arguments onto a `ValidationConfig`:

  ```python
  # Before
  strategy.register_hook(
      EvaluateHook(validation_data=val_data, every_n_epochs=1)
  )

  # After
  strategy.validation_config = ValidationConfig(
      validation_data=val_data, every_n_epochs=1
  )
  ```

   Validation then runs automatically during `strategy.run(...)` at the
   configured cadence and once at end-of-training. The `EvaluationSink` /
   `EvaluationZarrSink` output classes were removed; replace summary logging
   with an `AFTER_VALIDATION` hook and per-batch logging with a
   `ValidationConfig(batch_callback=...)`.
