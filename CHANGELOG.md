# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Add support for PEFT fine-tuning within `FineTuningStrategy`, including
  LoRA workflows with `LoRAConfig`, `load_peft_checkpoint_into_model`,
  and base-model fingerprint checks for PEFT checkpoint loading.
- Domain decomposition for distributed inference and dynamics: a spatial halo
  strategy and a graph-parallel strategy, both driven by a declarative
  `MLIPSpec` a model wrapper publishes as `distribution_spec`. Ewald, PME,
  MACE, AIMNet2 and UMA ship specs; composed pipelines decompose per stage.
  Energy, forces and stress agree with a single-GPU reference to fp32 rounding
  under both strategies, eager and compiled. `nvalchemi.distributed.pin_fp32`
  pins full-precision fp32 for runs that must match a reference, since TF32
  makes distributed and single-process results diverge well beyond fp32 noise.

- MACE training example for end-to-end model training workflows.
- `EMAHook._build_averaged_model` override seam, so a caller that owns
  model sharding can supply a pre-built `AveragedModel` instead of the
  default deepcopy — enabling EMA on `fully_shard` (FSDP2) / DTensor
  models. Default behaviour unchanged.
- Checkpointable training hooks. Hooks such as EMA can now save restart
  state with strategy checkpoints, so resumed training keeps averaged
  weights instead of starting them over.
- Training strategy checkpoint restart support, including a periodic
  checkpoint hook for step- or epoch-based saves and restart loading with
  models, optimizers, schedulers, runtime counters, and restart-safe device
  placement.
- PhysicsNeMo-compatible atomic datapipes with `MultiDataset` composition,
  multidataset-aware sampling policies, and fused batch loading that preserves
  the Zarr reader's coalesced I/O path.
- First-class validation on `TrainingStrategy`. Set a `ValidationConfig`
  on `strategy.validation_config` and validation runs automatically at the
  configured step or epoch cadence, plus one final pass at end-of-training;
  the latest summary is stored on `strategy.last_validation`. Mechanics live
  in a public, context-managed `ValidationLoop` that can also be run
  standalone outside training. An `inference_model` slot lets EMA (or SWA /
  a distillation teacher) publish averaged weights for validation to read.
  A new `AFTER_VALIDATION` hook stage fires immediately after each pass so
  loggers can read the live summary. For per-batch logging, pass a
  `batch_callback` (any object matching the `BatchValidationCallback`
  protocol) on the config; it is invoked once per validation batch with the
  batch, predictions, and per-batch loss.
- Metric-driven learning-rate schedulers. `ReduceLROnPlateau` is now
  supported via `OptimizerConfig.scheduler_metric_adapter` (a summary-dict
  key string or a callable). Time-based schedulers step every optimizer
  step as before; metric-driven schedulers step only at validation
  checkpoints, where the validation summary supplies the metric.

### Model Wrappers

- **Pipeline neighbor-list adaptation policy** — `PipelineModelWrapper`
  now accepts `neighbor_adaptation` (`"auto"`, `"always"`, `"never"`) and
  `max_cutoff_ratio` (default `1.5`). The default `"auto"` mode only filters
  a source neighbor list for a smaller cutoff when the source cutoff is at most
  `max_cutoff_ratio` times the target cutoff; larger gaps get separate source
  lists. `"always"` builds one max-cutoff source list, while `"never"` builds
  exact cutoff source groups and skips cutoff filtering.

### Core Data Layer

- **In-memory datapipes** - new `InMemoryDataset` stores a fully materialized
  `Batch` in memory and serves graph-indexed `Batch` selections through the
  same `load_batches` / fused-prefetch interface used by `DataLoader`. It can
  be constructed from an existing `Batch` or materialized from a reader in
  chunks, with optional field-level metadata and batch transforms.
- **User-specified transforms** - `Dataset` accepts a `transforms=` kwarg
  (per-sample `(AtomicData, metadata) -> (AtomicData, metadata)`) and
  `DataLoader` accepts a `batch_transforms=` kwarg (per-batch `Batch -> Batch`).
  Both default to `None` (backward compatible). New `nvalchemi.data.transforms`
  subpackage exposes a polymorphic `Compose` utility plus `SampleTransform`
  and `BatchTransform` type aliases, re-exported from `nvalchemi.data`.
  Per-sample transforms run after device transfer on both sync and prefetch
  paths; per-batch transforms run on the consumer thread after `Batch.from_data_list`.
  Transform failures are wrapped in `RuntimeError` with `transform[<i>]`
  breadcrumb and `__cause__` preserved.

### Models

- **UMA (fairchem-core) wrapper** — new `UMAWrapper` exposes UMA
  (Universal Models for Atoms) foundation models (`uma-s-1p1`,
  `uma-s-1p2`, `uma-m-1p1`) through the `BaseModelMixin` interface,
  ready for any dynamics engine or standalone inference. UMA is
  multi-task; the wrapper is pinned to one head at construction (OMol,
  OMat, OC20, ODAC, OMC). Input conversion is tensor-native (no ASE
  round trip); energy is the differentiable primitive with forces and
  (for periodic tasks) stress from autograd. Install via the new `uma`
  optional CUDA variants (`pip install 'nvalchemi-toolkit[uma-cu12]'` or
  `nvalchemi-toolkit[uma-cu13]`), which remain incompatible with `mace` because
  of their `e3nn` pins. `from_checkpoint` forwards fairchem's `inference_settings`,
  including the compiled `"default"` and `"turbo"` presets and the eager
  `"batch"` preset. See the
  `examples/advanced/09_uma_nve.py` NVE/NVT/NPT walkthrough.

### Fixed

- **UMA CUDA dependency resolution** — add standalone `uma-cu12` and
  `uma-cu13` extras. They select the matching torch build without installing
  PhysicsNeMo's RAPIDS extras, whose numba upper bound conflicts with Fairchem
  2.22.

- **int32 batch pointers in the Warp segment-expansion kernel** —
  `Batch.index_select` raised from `_expand_segments_warp` on CUDA whenever the
  storage held its `batch_ptr` in int32, which is what the storage constructor
  casts an explicit pointer to and therefore what every `clone()` and device
  move produces once the pointer has been materialized — a path dynamics reach
  through the compaction `refill_check` performs on a batch moved after its
  pointer was built. The pointer slices the kernel reads are now cast to the
  launch dtype, so a moved or cloned batch selects on the accelerator like any
  other.
- **Segment expansion on a non-default GPU** — the Warp expansion kernel behind
  `Batch.index_select` was launched against whichever CUDA device happened to be
  current, so a batch whose storage records a bare `cuda` while its tensors live
  on another GPU read unmapped memory (`an illegal memory access was
  encountered`) on every host where the current device is not `cuda:0`, and the
  launch left that device selected for the rest of the process. The kernel now
  launches on the device the batch pointer lives on and restores the caller's
  current device.
- **Level storages recorded an unresolved device** — `to_device("cuda")` and
  construction with `device="cuda"` stored the bare request while the tensors
  landed on whichever GPU was current, so the storage's `device` disagreed with
  its own data as soon as the current device changed and later pointer builds
  and concatenations raised `Expected all tensors to be on the same device`. A
  bare `cuda` is now resolved to the current device at the moment it is
  recorded.
- **Appending a CPU batch onto an accelerator batch** — `Batch.append` and
  `SegmentedLevelStorage.concatenate` moved every contributed tensor to the
  target device except `segment_lengths`, so mixing a CPU source into a CUDA
  target raised `Expected all tensors to be on the same device` out of
  `torch.cat`. The segment lengths are now moved like everything else.
- **Low-precision graph-balanced losses** — `per_graph_sum` accumulated in the
  input dtype, and CUDA scatter atomics round after every add, so a bf16 running
  sum stopped growing at 256 and an fp16 one at 2048. A per-atom-normalized
  force loss over 3000 atoms was wrong by a factor of 3.6 in bf16 and 10% in
  fp16. Sums now accumulate in at least fp32 and are returned in fp32 for
  half-precision inputs — on the padded `(B, V_max, 3)` force layout as well
  as the dense `(V, 3)` one — so a per-graph total past the fp16 ceiling of
  65504 no longer saturates to `inf` before the loss normalizes it, and a
  half-precision force loss returns the same fp32 value whichever layout it is
  given; fp32 and fp64 results are unchanged.
- **Demo model embeddings on a batch** — `DemoModelWrapper.compute_embeddings`
  set `node_embeddings` as a plain attribute, which a `Batch` routes to its
  system group, so the per-atom tensor failed the batch-size check and the call
  raised on every batch. Node embeddings are now written to the atoms group, as
  the MACE wrapper already does.
- **`TrainingStrategy.validate()` before `run()`** — models were moved to
  `devices` only by `run()` and the checkpoint restore path, so a standalone
  validation pass on a CUDA strategy fed GPU batches to CPU models and failed
  with `Expected all tensors to be on the same device`. `validate()` now makes
  the same (idempotent) move.
- **Checkpoint resume across devices** — a live restore loaded weights and
  optimizer state onto the device recorded in the checkpoint rather than the one
  the live strategy runs on, and `run()` reused resumed optimizer state without
  following the models it had just moved. Resuming a `cuda:0` checkpoint on
  another GPU, or on a rank a `DDPHook` re-pins, died in the first optimizer
  step with `Expected all tensors to be on the same device`. Live restores now
  target the live device, and the new
  `nvalchemi.training.rehome_optimizer_state` helper (applied automatically
  whenever a resumed optimizer is reused, by `run()` and by `train_batch()`)
  moves resumed state onto its parameters, including tensors a custom optimizer
  nests inside dicts, lists, or tuples.
- **Ewald charge gradients and cell derivatives** — the reciprocal term was only
  ever differentiated with respect to positions and charges, so a non-hybrid
  Ewald returned a wrong `dE/dq`, and strain-autograd through the detached
  Green's function gave a wrong stress. Work needing a cell derivative now
  routes to the staged reciprocal.
- **Ewald / PME strain cache** — cached k-vectors were rebuilt from the strained
  cell, so a second stress evaluation reused the first call's autograd graph.

- **Distributed dynamics lifecycle** — keep per-system integrator state aligned
  when pipeline receives and graduates systems, clear reusable communication
  buffers before every send without shrinking their segmented capacity, and run
  distributed stages with explicit per-system step budgets and optional early
  convergence.
- **Zarr dataloader custom fields** — validated `Dataset` batch paths now
  preserve reader field-level metadata so custom atom-, edge-, and
  system-level tensors survive batching like the `skip_validation` path.
- EMA checkpointing now restores averaged tensors to the corresponding live
  model tensor devices, publishes restored EMA weights during SETUP before validation,
  and supports callable reconstruction specs for model wrappers that must
  rebuild from factory methods, including MACE checkpoints with
  cuEquivariance enabled.
- **NVT Nosé-Hoover velocity collapse** (#104) — reset the NHC
  `total_scale` scratch accumulator to the multiplicative identity on
  each chain update, preventing persistent state from zeroing or
  compounding velocity rescaling.
- **MTK NPT barostat runaway** (#89, #90) — four bugs in
  `nvalchemi/dynamics/integrators/npt.py` (with matching fixes in
  `nph.py`) that combined to drive unbounded cell-volume drift in long
  NPT runs. Cross-validated against ASE `MTKNPT`/`IsotropicMTKNPT` and
  TorchSim `npt_nose_hoover_isotropic`. Isotropic users will see their
  barostat mass `W` shrink by 3× (now matches canonical MTK).
- **Ewald / PME energies buffer leak** (#82) — in-place `scatter_add_`
  of gradient-carrying `per_atom_energies` chained each forward's Warp
  backward tape onto `_energies_buf`, causing linear per-step slowdown
  and unbounded GPU memory growth. `detach_()` the buffer after each
  forward.
- **FusedStage graduation not reported** — `FusedStage.step()` returned
  `exit_converged=None` for samples graduated via a sub-stage's `n_steps`
  counter or its `ConvergenceHook`, so consumers of the returned indices
  (e.g. `DistributedPipeline`) silently dropped such samples.

### Deprecated

- `cells_inv` argument on `_cell_kinetic_energy`. Cell kinetic energy
  is computed directly from the strain rate `ε̇` and no longer needs
  the cell inverse. The argument is retained for backwards
  compatibility (a `DeprecationWarning` is emitted when passed) and
  will be removed in a future release.

### Breaking Changes

- `EwaldModelWrapper` and `PMEModelWrapper` now default to `hybrid_forces=False`.
  The analytic direct-output path (`hybrid_forces=True`) does not produce
  consistent gradients and is not supported under domain decomposition, where
  `distribution_spec` rejects it. Forces and stress now come from autograd over
  the energy; pass `hybrid_forces=True` explicitly to keep the old path.

- Dataset-level explicit batch reads now use `load_batches(...)`. The raw
  `read_many(...)` API remains on readers, where storage backends can optimize
  ordered I/O, but `Dataset.read_many(...)` and `Dataset.get_batch(...)` have
  been removed to keep the public Dataset API focused on sample access,
  batch materialization, and prefetching.
- Split hook context state into `HookContext`, `DynamicsContext`, and
  `TrainContext` so each workflow exposes only the fields it owns.
  Dynamics-specific state such as `step_count`, `converged_mask`, and
  `global_rank` now lives on `DynamicsContext`, while training state lives on
  `TrainContext`. Existing hooks that used `HookContext` for dynamics-only
  fields should update their annotations to `DynamicsContext`.
- Standardized public `stress` outputs on tensile-positive Cauchy stress
  (`sigma = -W / V`) while keeping low-level virials defined as negative
  strain derivatives.
- Removed `EvaluateHook` in favor of first-class validation on
  `TrainingStrategy`. Validation is no longer a registered hook. Migrate by
  moving the hook's arguments onto a `ValidationConfig`:

  ```python
  # Before
  strategy.register_hook(
      EvaluateHook(validation_data=val_data, every_n_epochs=1)
  )

  # After
  strategy.validation_config = ValidationConfig(
      validation_data=val_data, every_n_epochs=1
  )
  ```

   Validation then runs automatically during `strategy.run(...)` at the
   configured cadence and once at end-of-training. The `EvaluationSink` /
   `EvaluationZarrSink` output classes were removed; replace summary logging
   with an `AFTER_VALIDATION` hook and per-batch logging with a
   `ValidationConfig(batch_callback=...)`.
